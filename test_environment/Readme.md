## Introduction

The Test Environment for the Product Price Fetcher is a Flask application designed to test the functionality of the main product price fetching service. It provides a simple web interface to submit product names, make requests to the main service, and display the search results.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-price-fetcher.git
    cd product-price-fetcher
    ```

2. Install Flask:

    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

---

## Usage

### Running the Flask Test App

Execute the `test_app.py` script:

```bash
python test_app.py
```

Access the test application in your web browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Input

- Enter the product name in the provided form on the main page.

### Output

- The results page will display the prices for the specified product on different websites.

---

## Project Structure

The test environment follows a simple structure with the following main files:

1. **test_app.py**: The main Flask application handling requests and rendering templates.
2. **templates/result.html**: The template file for displaying search results.
3. **templates/index.html**: The template file for the main page with the input form.

---

## Modules and Components

### 1. test_app.py

- Initializes the Flask application.
- Defines routes for rendering the main page, handling form submissions, and displaying search results.
- Makes API requests to the main service to fetch product details.

### 2. result.html

- The template file for displaying search results.
- Iterates over the results and displays website, product, and price information.

### 3. index.html

- The template file for the main page.
- Includes a form to submit the product name.

---

## Logging

The test environment does not implement logging, as it is primarily for testing the front-end interaction and API requests.

---

## Error Handling

The application handles errors in API requests to the main service and displays error messages accordingly.

---

## Conclusion

The Flask test environment provides a convenient way to test the functionality of the Product Price Fetcher. It simulates user interaction with a simple web interface and showcases the integration of the main service.
